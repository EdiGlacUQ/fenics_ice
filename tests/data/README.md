This directory contains data (thickness, bed, etc rasters) & 'observed_velocity' for the ismipc cases used by the test suite.

Note that the ice_stream test case has its data within the example\_cases/ice\_stream/input folder. This is a little untidy - probably the stuff in this folder should be moved into example\_cases.
